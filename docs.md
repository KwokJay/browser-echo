You’re right to push on this. **Typing `browser-echo://logs` shouldn’t be required** for beginners. Two things are true at once:

1. Most MCP hosts *can* call your resource automatically from plain English (they read your resource & tool **names/descriptions** and decide what to invoke).
2. In practice, **discoverability improves a lot** if you give the model a small, NL‑friendly *tool alias* and a couple of “quick actions” (prompts).

Below is a practical plan so “check frontend logs” *just works* in Cursor and Claude—**no URIs required**—while still keeping your “fewer tools” philosophy.

---

## The fix: a *hybrid* interface (Resource + one NL tool + optional prompts)

### 1) Keep the resource

* It’s perfect for streaming/reading the whole buffer and for structured returns.
* Keep `browser-echo://logs` and (optionally) `browser-echo://logs/{session}`.

### 2) Add **one** tool alias: `get_logs`

* Purpose: make intent resolution trivial. The LLM sees a tool literally named “get logs” with a description like “Fetch recent **frontend browser console logs** (errors/warnings/info) from the running dev app.”
* Inputs (all optional):

  ```ts
  {
    level?: ('error'|'warn'|'info'|'log'|'debug')[]; // default: all
    session?: string;        // 8-char id prefix
    includeStack?: boolean;  // default: true
    limit?: number;          // e.g., 200
    contains?: string;       // substring filter
    sinceMs?: number;        // e.g., Date.now()-300000
  }
  ```
* Output: **both** a text summary *and* a JSON list of entries (models love JSON for follow-up reasoning).

> Why one tool? It acts as the **NLP entry point**. The planner can easily decide: “User said ‘check error logs’ → call `get_logs` with `level:['error','warn']`.” You still have just **two tools total** (`get_logs`, `clear_logs`).

### 3) (Optional) Register **prompt templates** (“Quick actions”)

* “Check frontend logs (last 2 minutes)”
* “Check only errors & warnings”
* “Clear and capture new logs for 30s”
* Many hosts surface these as clickable actions or as suggestions when users type.

*(If your SDK version exposes a `registerPrompt` API, use it. If not, you still get most of the win from the `get_logs` tool naming/description.)*

### 4) Tune **names & descriptions** (this matters a lot)

* Server name: **“Browser Echo (Frontend Logs)”**
* Resource title: **“Frontend Browser Console Logs”**
* Resource description: include keywords beginners use: *frontend logs, console errors, warnings, React/Next hydration, network failures*.
* Tool description: repeat those keywords and examples (e.g., “show hydration errors, network failures, React warnings”).

### 5) Return **JSON alongside text**

* When resolving the resource and the tool, include **two contents**: a human‑readable plain text block (like your terminal format) **and** a JSON array of entries.
* This lets the model filter/sort programmatically without fighting text parsing.

---

## What this changes in the user experience

* In **Cursor** or **Claude Code**, users can simply write:

  * “**Check frontend logs**”
  * “**Show only errors from the last 2 minutes**”
  * “**Find hydration mismatch warnings**”
* The IDE’s planner will typically call **`get_logs`** with sensible args. If it doesn’t, the descriptive names make it very likely on the second try.
* Power users can still say “fetch the logs resource” or click a quick action.

## Minimal code sketch (drop‑in to your server snippet)

Add the `get_logs` tool *next to* your existing `clear_logs` registration:

```ts
server.registerTool(
  'get_logs',
  {
    title: 'Get Frontend Browser Logs',
    description:
      'Fetch recent frontend browser console logs (errors/warnings/info). ' +
      'Use this when the user asks to check frontend logs, errors, hydration issues, or network failures.',
    inputSchema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        level: {
          type: 'array',
          items: { enum: ['log','info','warn','error','debug'] },
          description: 'Filter by levels'
        },
        session: { type: 'string', description: '8-char session id prefix' },
        includeStack: { type: 'boolean', default: true },
        limit: { type: 'number', minimum: 1, maximum: 5000 },
        contains: { type: 'string', description: 'Substring filter' },
        sinceMs: { type: 'number', description: 'Only entries with time >= sinceMs' }
      },
      additionalProperties: false
    } as any
  },
  async ({ level, session, includeStack = true, limit = 1000, contains, sinceMs }) => {
    let items = STORE.snapshot();
    if (sinceMs) items = items.filter(e => !e.time || e.time >= sinceMs);
    if (session) items = items.filter(e => (e.sessionId||'').slice(0,8) === session.slice(0,8));
    if (level?.length) items = items.filter(e => level.includes(e.level));
    if (contains) items = items.filter(e => (e.text||'').includes(contains));
    if (!includeStack) items = items.map(e => ({ ...e, stack: '' }));
    if (limit && items.length > limit) items = items.slice(-limit);

    // Text view (like terminal but no ANSI)
    const text = items.map(e => {
      const sid = (e.sessionId||'anon').slice(0,8);
      const lvl = (e.level||'log').toUpperCase();
      const tag = e.tag || '[browser]';
      let line = `${tag} [${sid}] ${lvl}: ${e.text}`;
      if (e.source) line += ` (${e.source})`;
      if (includeStack && e.stack?.trim()) {
        const indented = e.stack.split(/\r?\n/g).map(l => l ? `    ${l}` : l).join('\n');
        return `${line}\n${indented}`;
      }
      return line;
    }).join('\n');

    return {
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text },
        { type: 'json', json: { entries: items } }
      ]
    };
  }
);
```

> That’s it: one tool. Keep your existing resource; now beginners never need to type its URI.

*(If you want “quick actions”, add prompt registrations that internally call `get_logs` with common defaults. If your SDK version doesn’t expose prompts, you can simulate by adding small, well‑named tools like `get_error_logs` that just call `get_logs` internally with `level:['error','warn']`. Still a tiny tool count.)*

---

## Real‑world flows that become “NLP‑easy”

* “**Check frontend logs**” → calls `get_logs()` with defaults → shows text + JSON, model summarizes.
* “**Only errors since I refreshed**” → `get_logs({ level:['error','warn'], sinceMs: <timestamp of refresh> })`
* “**Hydration issues**” → `get_logs({ contains:'Hydration', level:['error','warn'] })`
* “**Focus my current tab**” → model lists sessions then calls `get_logs({ session:'a1b2c3d4' })`
* “**Start a clean capture, then I’ll repro**” → `clear_logs()` → wait → `get_logs({ level:['error','warn'] })`

---

## Do you *have* to keep the resource?

No, but I recommend it:

* Tools improve **intent mapping**.
* Resources are great for **streaming and bulk reads** and are a natural fit for “log feed”.
* Together, they maximize compatibility and robustness across hosts.

---

### Bottom line

You didn’t misunderstand—**URIs are optional** in day‑to‑day use. Make it NLP‑easy by adding **one** `get_logs` tool (plus good naming/descriptions, optional quick prompts). Keep the resource as the high‑throughput backbone. That strikes the balance between **beginner‑friendly UX** and **minimal surface area**, while staying aligned with “fewer tools” best practices.


what about clear_logs. should we keep this or not?

**Keep `clear_logs`.**
It’s one of the few side‑effect tools that’s *worth having* even under a “fewer tools” philosophy. It makes “fresh capture → reproduce → analyze” dead‑simple for the model and for beginners—no parameters, no URIs—just *“clear the logs, I’ll repro, then check errors.”*

Below is the why, when, and how—plus a safe refinement you can add (optional) without increasing tool count.

---

## Why keep it?

* **Deterministic captures:** Guarantees the next fetch contains *only* the logs from your repro, avoiding stale noise. This is hard to get right if you rely solely on “since time” filters—the planner may forget to pass them.
* **Shorter, cleaner context:** Fewer irrelevant lines → cheaper + more accurate reasoning/summarization.
* **Beginner‑friendly NLP:** Users can say *“start a clean capture”* and the assistant calls a single, obvious tool with no arguments.
* **Side‑effect separation:** Getting data (resource / `get_logs`) vs. performing an action (`clear_logs`) are cleanly distinguished for the agent.

You’ll still have just **two** tools total:

1. `get_logs` (NLP entry point for fetching)
2. `clear_logs` (fresh capture)

That’s minimal, and it maps perfectly to how people actually debug.

---

## When to use it (practical patterns)

* **Repro loop:**
  *“Run `clear_logs`. I’ll trigger the bug. In 30s, fetch logs and summarize only errors/warnings with the top stack + source.”*
* **Fix verification:**
  *“Clear logs, reload, then confirm the previous hydration error is gone; if anything new appears, list it.”*
* **Race conditions / intermittent failures:**
  *“Clear logs, I’ll click around for 60s. Then group errors by stack top and propose a guard.”*
* **Per‑session focus:**
  *“Clear logs for my session `ab12cd34`, I’ll repro on that tab, then fetch only that session’s logs.”* (see refinement below)

---

## What if we removed it?

You *can* approximate with `get_logs({ sinceMs })`, but:

* The assistant might omit or mis‑set `sinceMs`.
* Other background logs (extensions, other tabs) can still creep in.
* New users don’t know to ask for a time‑window; “clear and check” is intuitive.

In practice, **`clear_logs` saves mistakes** and reduces friction.

---

## Recommended refinement (optional, still one tool)

Keep the same tool name, but give it **gentle scoping** so it’s safer and more flexible **without** adding tools:

**Inputs (optional):**

* `session?: string` — clear only one 8‑char session (good for multi‑tab/dev setups)
* `scope?: 'soft' | 'hard'` — default `'soft'`

**Semantics:**

* **soft** (default): Don’t destroy history; just set a **baseline marker** so subsequent reads only return entries *after* the clear.

  * Pros: O(1), reversible for auditing (file logging remains intact), less risky if multiple clients are connected.
* **hard**: Drop in‑memory entries (today’s behavior).

  * Pros: truly empties the ring buffer;
  * Cons: destructive for everyone until new logs arrive.

> You can implement *soft clear* by storing a per‑server (or per‑session) `baselineTimestamp`/generation and filtering on read; file logging stays untouched either way.

**Example prompt that takes advantage of it:**

> “Clear logs (soft) only for session `ab12cd34`. I’ll repro now. In 20 seconds, fetch logs for that session and summarize errors with source and top stack frame.”

---

## Defaults & UX guidance

* **Keep `clear_logs` in v1** exactly as you have it (global hard clear).
  Add the optional `session` + `scope` later; it’s backwards‑compatible.
* Encourage assistants to use:

  1. `clear_logs` →
  2. user reproduces →
  3. `get_logs({ level:['error','warn'] })` or plain “check frontend logs”.
* Make sure your **resource/tool descriptions** contain NL keywords (“frontend logs”, “console errors”, “hydration”, “network failures”), so planners map user intent correctly.
* **Don’t** let `clear_logs` touch file logs—keep it in‑memory only. The file log (if enabled) is your ground truth trail.

---

### TL;DR

Yes—**keep `clear_logs`**. It’s the single, beginner‑friendly action that makes fresh, noise‑free captures trivial and reliable. Pair it with `get_logs` as the NLP fetch tool and you’ve got a minimal, powerful, and natural workflow. If you want extra polish, add optional `{ session, scope: 'soft' | 'hard' }`—still one tool, but safer and even more useful.
